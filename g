To verify the emulator card was outputting the correct number of pulses, we ran the card at 1 m/s (i.e., 1000 mm/s) and captured a 1000 µs (0.001 s) oscilloscope window. In that time window, the distance traveled is . With the pulse interval set to 0.1 mm per pulse, the expected pulse count is . The captured waveform shows 10 pulses within the 1000 µs window, confirming the emulator card is generating the correct pulse output for the commanded speed and pulse spacing.
