Stitching calibration between consecutive passes from a single scanner has been completed.
The original plan was to calibrate the stitch transform using an overlapped scan of a single fiducial. However, this approach introduced a small alignment error that increased significantly for points farther away from the fiducial (i.e., error amplification across the scan extent).
Updated approach and result:
Using two fiducials / two reference regions provides a much better-constrained transform and reduces the positional drift seen with the single-fiducial method. This improves alignment stability across the full point cloud and produces a significantly better stitching transform between consecutive passes.
