TIM has to be applied to design to meet satellite thermal performance. The goal of inspection is to remove unmonitored variability—things like nozzle-to-surface standoff, material behavior like viscosity, and surface prep differences. By measuring the dispense, we can standardize expectations, catch drift early, and make results consistent across operators, tools, and builds
