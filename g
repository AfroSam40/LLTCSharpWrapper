Yes. Vendor confirmed scan frequency is driven by exposure time, FOV, and points/profile. I was able to hit the advertised 4800 Hz by setting the X and Z FOV to 5%, which suggests the emulator card is outputting the correct pulse count and there are no wiring issues.
Since points/profile is fixed, our only levers to increase speed are exposure time and FOV. We don’t want to shrink X FOV, so the main constraint is required Z FOV (based on max step height of pallets/parts). Exposure time is the secondary limiter and depends on part/pallet reflectivity.
