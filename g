Last but not least is surface uniformity. We take the same Z-slices used for volume and radially cross-section them to generate a blob profile. Then we compare that profile against a min/max envelope—and any region that falls outside the envelope gets flagged as a shape defect, like poo blobs, duck tails, or pancakes.
