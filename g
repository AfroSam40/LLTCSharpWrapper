We’re executing this in three phases. Phase one is Z-comp: find the fiducials, align into the pallet frame, and output Z-offsets back to the machine. Phase two expands that to the full coordinate transform plus Z-offsets, with limited new development—mainly supporting the dispense team to ensure end-to-end functionality. Phase three is inspection: use the dev system and the factory to collect a large dataset, iterate on the algorithms, and then close out with a dedicated review and qualification plan to make sure we meet the requirements and get full team buy-in
