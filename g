First, volume. We’re targeting ±10% of the requested dispense, across a pretty wide range—from 0.1 cc up to 100 cc—so the process is repeatable regardless of shot size.
Second, location. We want each blob placed within 2 mm true position in XY, so recipe points reliably map to what actually gets dispensed.
Third, shape and height control. We’re holding Z within ±0.2 mm to keep the stand-off consistent and avoid defects like pancakes, tails, or “poo” blobs.
