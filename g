Still need to incorporate the transform from scanner coordinates to machine coordinates. The scanner and probe will locate one fiducial near the front of the gantry work area to establish a common reference. Feature locations from CAD can then be transformed first into the work-object frame (using the pallet fiducial) and then into the machine coordinate frame (using the fiducial located by the probe). This will enable compensation for pallet-to-machine error stack-up
