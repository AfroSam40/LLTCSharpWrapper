Hi Jerry,

I reviewed the point cloud using the recommended settings. While the capture works, the ambient light is inducing significant artifacts in the data, and the impact is large enough that it would affect performance/quality for our use case.

In parallel, we’ve identified another sensor that’s a better fit for the application, and we’ll be moving forward with that option instead.

Thank you again for all your support and help throughout this process.

Best regards,
Simon
