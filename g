Scan speed is limited by the total cycle time per profile: exposure time plus the processing/transfer time needed to convert the receiver image into a profile. If we move faster than that cycle time supports, the scanner will miss/ignore pulses that occur while it’s still exposing or processing, so we end up with fewer profiles per unit distance (lower point density / gaps).
